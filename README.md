# python-bottle-upload-download-https


I chose python for this project since from the look of it it looked like there required less of code.
To run this project you will require python install in your machine. 
Running this code from Linux is preferred. 

Run the following lines from command line 

sudo apt-get install python (This to install python)
sudo apt-get install bottle (This is the framework I'm using to pass variables from my HTML files to my python script to perform the get post functions)

Now run the code from command line after going to the location -> python performgetpost.py

This will give you the following output  - 


Ip address oflocalhost is 127.0.0.1and we are connected!
Bottle v0.12.7 server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
Listening on http://localhost:8080/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.

It means that the server is on and we're connected with the server.

Now to perform post request go to the following link - 

http://localhost:8080/upload

To perform get request go to the following link - 

http://localhost:8080/download

REMEMBER: The location from which you run this code will be your server directory.  


The code runs the required functions. I'd love to give a demo if incase any clarification regarding my code is required. Thank you.
